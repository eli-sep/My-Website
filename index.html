        <p>So being the day after Thanksgiving, not much is happening today.  I was supposed to help Ian move things into and out of Krusty's house.  He and my sister are planning on moving back into Krusty's house.  I guess living with my parents - probably mostly with my dad - can be difficult.  This ended up not working out.  I guess Ian and Rachel are getting phones an it took longer than expected.</p>
        
        <p>Besides that it has been kind of lazy day.  I have been playing "99 Nights in the Forest" on Roblox, which I really need to stop doing by the way, it is very addictive.  Also I currently am on Khan Academy learning HTML and CSS.  I am planning on starting a blog project to help with my learning and also it would probably be good for me to wrote down what is going on for me.  Getting in touch with myself.</p>
        
        <p>I do have a meeting later today with is good for me.  They definitely keep me accountable and disciplined.  I need more balance in my life.  I very much enjoy technical subjects and learning about programming with different languages and software and understanding the physical world but I also need down time where I am present in the now.  I need to be able to sit with my emotion, look around and observer and be aware of my environment.  I try to work on thing that are goals for the future but tend to neglect the present and the things I currently have in my life.</p>

    <p class="showcase1">This blog is also to show my journey to become a software developer.  I am currently learning HTML and CSS on Khan Academy.  I have already took a Javascript course on KA.  In this post I have style two fonts so for.  I have also styled this paragraph to showcase things I have learned with HTML and CSS so far. The blue background in this paragraph, the "Turret Road" font, and the white color are all done using CSS id selection. I have also learned about lists and using generic fonts for computers when specific fonts are not available. (See below).  I can <strong>bold</strong> text with the <strong>strong</strong> tag and <em>italicize</em> text with the <em>em</em> tag.</p>
        
        <ol class="showcase1"><strong>Different types of generic fonts.</strong>
            <li id="sans_li">This is an example of sans-serif font</li>
            <li id="serif_li">This is an example of serif font</li>
            <li id="cursive_li">This is an example of cursive font</li>
            <li id="fantasy_li">This is an example of fantasy font</li>
            <li id="monospace_li">This is an example of monospacefont</li>
        </ol>
        
        
        <p class="showcase1">I have also learned how to insert images and create hyperlinks.</p>
        
        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b6/Pencil_drawing_of_a_girl_in_ecstasy.jpg" alt="This is alt text.  The image is a hand-drawn sketch of a lady whipping her head back with eyes closed.  Her hair is also whipping down from the top of her head to herback.  She looks very peaceful.">
        <br>
        This is "Pencil drawing of a girl in ecstasy."
        <br>
        The drawing is by <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:LearnIndology&action=edit&redlink=1">Kushboo</a> and here is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image#/media/File:Pencil_drawing_of_a_girl_in_ecstasy.jpg">link to the artwork.</a>
        <p class="showcase1">I have also learned about tables.  Below is a table about different HTML and CSS concepts I have learned.</p>
        
    <table>
        <th>HTML</th>
        <th>CSS</th>
        <tr>
            <td>h1-h6, p, & body</td>
            <td>color & background-color</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>em & strong</td>
            <td>id selector</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>lists & images</td>
            <td>class selector</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>link & tables</td>
            <td>font-family & font-size</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>comments</td>
            <td>font-weight & font-weigh</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
